# Roku Another World Experiment

This is a quick experemental port of Another World (game developed by Eric Chahi and released in 1991) engine, made just as studies about BrightScript 2D gamming API (Roku devices).

[awjs](https://github.com/gmegidish/awjs) (JavaScript port) by Gil Megidish used as a base.

Runs just one level and full of bugs ;)

If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/AWEXP

Keys: UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT - move, OK - fire, PLAY - pause/resume. Roku can't handle two keys the same time, so: REPLAY - hold fire/run, INFO - release fire/run, REW - hold Down, FWD - release Down.

Have fun!
